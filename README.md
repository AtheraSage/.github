AtheraSage™
We’re building open-source robots with AI Personality Skins (APS) — modular overlays that add emotional depth and psychological nuance to conversational AI, entirely grounded in ethical design principles. Think: personality-as-a-plugin.

🧠 Use Cases — Real & Imagined:
A robotic caregiver offers 24/7 compassionate support for aging-in-place patients — with emergency response built in.

Coffee with Abraham Lincoln? Einstein? Pick from a growing APS library of legendary minds.

Preserve your own personality for future generations — wit, voice, and values as a digital heirloom.


See DATA_SECURITY.md for implementation details, including how we ensure all processing remains on-device—no hidden network calls, no surveillance, no silent data collection.


🛠️ Development Roadmap
AtheraSage will roll out in two focused phases—beginning with a lightweight prototype and evolving into a flagship platform designed for expressive, real-world AI interaction.

⚙️ Phase One: Prototype
A functional proof-of-concept demonstrating our core principles: local inferencing, modular personality integration, and privacy-by-design. Built with accessible hardware and openly documented to encourage experimentation and feedback.

🚀 Phase Two: Flagship
A full-featured, upgradable AI companion offering richer interaction, physical expressiveness, and refined personality overlays. Designed for deployment in educational, caregiving, and creative environments—fully offline, deeply personal.

Roadmap subject to iteration. Detailed build notes and technical documentation will be maintained in our private development channels until public release milestones are reached.

🌍 Building in Public
We believe powerful AI should be open, inspectable, and remixable —not locked behind NDAs. Our roadmap is transparent, but evolving. You’re welcome to follow, fork, or build alongside us.


🤝 Get Involved
We're calling on builders and open-source allies to help bring AtheraSage to life:
- Hardware tinkerers (embedded systems, motion control, sensor integration)
- AI developers (local inferencing, voice interaction, signal processing)
- Creative storytellers (tutorials, visual explainers, and educational docs)
