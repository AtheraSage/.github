# AtheraSage™

AtheraSage™ is a modular AI platform for building emotionally intelligent, privacy-first assistants—powered entirely by local large language models. At its core is the AI Personality Skins™ (APS) system: modular overlays that shape how your assistant listens, responds, and behaves. Each skin is inspired by distinct philosophies or communication styles and is opt-in, locally hosted, and deeply customizable. APS lets users define the tone, ethical lens, and personality of their AI—without altering its underlying intelligence. Fully open-source and cloud-free, AtheraSage puts autonomy, expression, and privacy back in your hands.

Use cases may include: 

👩‍⚕️️ A robotic nursing assistant with APS provides round the clock care for elderly patients who choose to live at home instead of a crowded nursing home. Changes in breathing, cries for help, etc. are immediately connected with 911. 

☕️ If you could have coffee with anyone from history, who would it be? Choose someone inspirational from the personality-skin library. 

🧠️ Create and preserve your own unique personality-skin for generations. Help your loved ones remember your legacy by providing an APS that will retain your mental likeness for posterity. 

🇺🇸️ Use a personality-skin inspired by Abraham Lincoln to help you write a persuasive speech to get that C-suite management promotion.

## 🛠️ Development Roadmap

AtheraSage will roll out in two focused phases—beginning with a lightweight prototype and evolving into a flagship platform designed for expressive, real-world AI interaction.

### ⚙️ Phase One: Prototype
A functional proof-of-concept demonstrating our core principles: local inferencing, modular personality integration, and privacy-by-design. Built with accessible hardware and openly documented to encourage experimentation and feedback.

### 🚀 Phase Two: Flagship
A full-featured, upgradable AI companion offering richer interaction, physical expressiveness, and refined personality overlays. Designed for deployment in educational, caregiving, and creative environments—fully offline, deeply personal.

Roadmap subject to iteration. Detailed build notes and technical documentation will be maintained in our private development channels until public release milestones are reached.

## 🌍 Building in Public

We believe powerful AI should be open, inspectable, and  remixable —not locked behind NDAs. Our roadmap is transparent, but evolving. You’re welcome to follow, fork, or build alongside us.

## 🤝 Get Involved
We're calling on builders and open-source allies to help bring AtheraSage to life:

- Hardware tinkerers (embedded systems, motion control, sensor integration)
- AI developers (local inferencing, voice interaction, signal processing)
- Creative storytellers (tutorials, visual explainers, and educational docs)
