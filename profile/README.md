# AtheraSage™

We’re building open-source robots with AI Personality Skins (APS) — modular overlays that add emotional depth and psychological nuance to conversational AI, entirely grounded in ethical design principles. Think: personality-as-a-plugin.

## Use Cases — Real & Imagined:
A robotic caregiver offers 24/7 compassionate support for aging-in-place patients — with emergency response built in.

Coffee with Abraham Lincoln? Einstein? Pick from a growing APS library of legendary minds.

Preserve your own personality for future generations — wit, voice, and values as a digital heirloom.

See `DATA_SECURITY.md` for implementation details, including how we ensure all processing remains on-device—no hidden network calls, no surveillance, no silent data collection.

## 🎯 Vision & Values

AtheraSage is building ethically grounded AI companions that are wise, trustworthy, and responsive — while keeping user privacy non-negotiable. Every interaction is powered locally, with no hidden network calls, no surveillance, and no silent data collection.

## 🤝 Get Involved
We're calling on builders and open-source allies to help bring AtheraSage to life:

- Hardware tinkerers (embedded systems, motion control, sensor integration)
- AI developers (local inferencing, voice interaction, signal processing)
- Creative storytellers (tutorials, visual explainers, and educational docs)
